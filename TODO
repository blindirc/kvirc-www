KNOWN BUGS
==========
1) Imho this css snippet cause more problems than the one that it solve:

.main img {layout4_text.css (line 117)
... (cut)
margin:3px 10px 7px 0pt;
... (cut)
}

This margin definition place the images near the navigators titles in a
strange position, causing also the first news to get that strange
indentation. Better move it out the .main namespace?
