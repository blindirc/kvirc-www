KNOWN BUGS
==========
1) Imho this css snippet cause more problems than the one that it solve:

.main img {layout4_text.css (line 117)
... (cut)
margin:3px 10px 7px 0pt;
... (cut)
}

This margin definition place the images near the navigators titles in a
strange position, causing also the first news to get that strange
indentation. Better move it out the .main namespace?

2) The "navbar" in header-breadcrumbs seems static. Should it follow
user navigation through the site's pages? It doesn't.
3) the image in page "status" is under the right menu
4) In http://www.kvirc.net/www/?id=screen&lang=it&page=4 (screenshot
page, after pressing the "next" link) the right menu goes out of the
main (<div class="main-subcontent"> is not inside <div class="main">)
8)
http://www.kvirc.net/www/?id=releases&lang=it&platform=source&version=3.2.0
The gray boxes goes a way toooo long to the right
