KNOWN BUGS
==========
1) Imho this css snippet cause more problems than the one that it solve:

.main img {layout4_text.css (line 117)
... (cut)
margin:3px 10px 7px 0pt;
... (cut)
}

This margin definition place the images near the navigators titles in a
strange position, causing also the first news to get that strange
indentation. Better move it out the .main namespace?

archive:
	links to old ml archives dowsn't work (in reality, the ml archive doesn't exist anymore);
tools:
	table class "despair" inherits margin definition from .main-content table (margin:2em 0pt 0.2em 20px;); this makes it show right-aligned, while it should be centered; maybe add a "margin:0;" to table.despair?
addons:
	the select inherts "padding:0;" from *, hiding part of the text inside it;
	table "despair" alignment as in "tools";
scripts:
	typo err, path valid only for version 3.2.4: "should be installed at <prefix>/share/kvirc/3.2.4[-extraversion]/defscript/default.kvs.";
	table cell text overflow, "cvs -z4 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.omnikron.net:/cvs";
themes:
	font in first <ol> is much bigger than in the rest of the page;
kvirc wiki:
	points to a no more existant webpage;
spanish manual:
	points to a no more existant webpage (why does only the spanish manual have a own item in the menu?);
faq:
	<ol> font size too big as in "themes";
require:
	<ul> font size too big as in "themes";
license:
	license text is shown under right column;
status:
	link to "<a href="/?id=news&amp;story=2005.02.27.16.29.1.story&amp;dir=latest&amp;lang=it">" should point to "<a href="?id=news&amp;story=2005.02.27.16.29.1.story&amp;dir=2005.02&amp;lang=it">";
news:
	some news (like this: ?id=news&lang=it&story=2006.11.04.14.50.1.story&dir=latest) shows under right column;

main page (all pages):
	"quick download" link to "<a href="/3.2.0/source/kvirc-3.2.0.tar.bz2" title="get the latest release">" should point to the ftp;
	imho the problem with the margin definition of ".main img" isn't solved;
