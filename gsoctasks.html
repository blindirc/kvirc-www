	<h2><a name="codereview">Code cleanups and documentation</a></h2>
	<div class="taskbody">
		<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p>
			The kvirc source code is becoming quite large. Junior developers
			are discouraged by its complexity and the lack of documentation
			about it. All the functionality must be guessed from source code
			analysis. Recently we have started documenting the source code
			with the Doxygen tool. We have also estabilished a self-documenting coding standard
			that should be followed in the source tree. The goal of this task is to
			<ul>
				<li>enforce the usage of coding standards in the whole source tree
				<li>add the missing Doxygen documentation for the core classes
			</ul> 
		</p>
		<p><strong>Details</strong></p>
		<div class="taskdetails">
			<p>Coding standard enforcement</p>
			<p>
				The student will be required to run through the whole source
				tree and:
				<ul>
					<li>Spot the places where improper variable and class names
					are used and fix them in order to enforce the usage of
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation" target="_blank">hungarian notation</a>
					to the degree estabilished by our <a href="https://svn.kvirc.de/kvirc/browser/trunk/kvirc/doc/hackers.guide.txt" target="_blank">coding standard</a>.
					<li>Evaluate the usage of global variables and possibly
					replace them with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern" target="_blank">singletons</a>.
					<li>Move the standalone C functions into C++ namespaces
					<li>Enforce other "good practice" programming patterns
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Doxygen documentation</p>
			<p>
				We ask the student to add <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_blank">doxygen</a>
				based documentation for all the classes contained in the <a href="https://svn.kvirc.de/kvirc/browser/trunk/kvirc/src/kvilib" target="_blank">kvilib library</a>
				and for the most important classes in the <a href="https://svn.kvirc.de/kvirc/browser/trunk/kvirc/src/kvirc" target="_blank">kvirc executable</a>.
				For each documented class we require at least an overall description and the documentation
				of the most important member functions (purpose, parameters and return value).

	<h2><a name="gendoc">User help subsystem cleanup</a></h2>
	<div class="taskbody">
		<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p>
			KVIrc has an <a href="http://www.kvirc.net/img/screenshots/snapshot6.jpg" target="_blank">internal help system</a>
			that provides <a href="http://www.kvirc.de/docu/" target="_blank">user documentation</a>
			about the program interface and scripting
			commands. The documentation text is extracted from the
			source code by the means of a perl script. The script
			produces html output that is distributed with the executable
			and displayed to the user by the means of a simple builtin html viewer.
			The perl script has been modified and adjusted
			several times in the past and has become unmantainable. The documentation
			produced also has several broken links and extraction defects.
			The goal of this task is to rewrite the documentation extraction
			tool (either in perl or maybe another portable language)
			in order to make it mantainable and produce an improved
			set of user help documents. The task may also involve modifying
			the help viewer to match the changes made on the extractor tool.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Details</strong></p>
		<div class="taskdetails">
			The actual <a href="https://svn.kvirc.de/kvirc/browser/trunk/kvirc/admin/gendoc.pl" target="_blank">document extraction tool</a>
			is a batch converter that processes the cpp sources given by the commandline. It parses the files
			looking for special kind of comments and produces a set of html files
			that are later presented to the user by the means of the <a href="http://www.kvirc.net/img/screenshots/snapshot6.jpg" target="_blank">internal help viewer</a>
			and distributed <a href="http://www.kvirc.de/docu/" target="_blank">via web</a>.
			The internal help viewer is actually implemented as a <a href="https://svn.kvirc.de/kvirc/browser/trunk/kvirc/src/modules/help" target="_blank">kvirc module</a>.
			We ask the student to:
			<ul>
				<li>Define a new polished user documentation structure (indexes, subsections, topic groups etc...)
				<li>Rewrite the <a href="https://svn.kvirc.de/kvirc/browser/trunk/kvirc/admin/gendoc.pl" target="_blank">document extraction tool</a>
						in order to match the structure defined above. The source code must be properly organized
						and commented in order to make in matainable in the future.
				<li>Review the documentation source for "hardcoded" broken links
				<li>Eventually adjust the internal help viewer to match the changes made in the document extraction tool
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p><strong>Required additional skills</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Knowledge of perl or another language that can be used to extract documentation from sources.
			<li>Basic knowledge of HTML
			<li>Possibly a decent knowledge of C++
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Difficulty</strong></p>
		<p>Medium</p>

	<h2><a name="cmakesupport">Cross platform build system</a></h2>
	<div class="taskbody">
		<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p>
			Building KVIrc on all the supported platforms is a complex task
			since every platform has a separate set of configurations and tools
			for this purpose. Most developers support only a single platform
			and are not able to verify their changes on all the other build systems.
			The goal of this task is to explore the usage of the <a href="http://www.cmake.org" target="_blank">CMake</a>
			build system along with its CPack extension in order to create
			a single consistent set of build configuration files for all the supported
			platforms.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Details</strong></p>
		<div class="taskdetails">
			We're actually using
			<ul>
				<li>Automake/Autoconf-based build system on linux
				<li>Visual Studio Express project files on windows
				<li>A modified automake/autoconf setup on macosx.
			</ul>
			<p>
			We want to have a single unified build system on all the platforms.
			We have attempted to use qmake, the Qt build tool, but we aren't satisfied
			by the final results. The other candidate is <a href="http://www.cmake.org" target="_blank">CMake</a>
			which seems to provide also a distribution subsystem called CSetup.
			The set of new build files should be created in a separate subdirectory
			of the source tree (say build/cmake) and the existing build systems shouldn't be removed
			until the new one is considered to be stable.
			</p>
		</div>
		<p><strong>Required additional skills</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Decent knowledge of C++
			<li>Experience in cross-platform application building (linux, windows and macosx).
			<li>CMake experience is a huge plus
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Difficulty</strong></p>
		<p>Medium</p>

	<h2><a name="addonpackaging">User-friendly script/addon packaging system</a></h2>
	<div class="taskbody">
		<p>
			KVIrc has a builtin scripting language that can be used
			to create various kinds of addons. The addons can include
			sets of new scripting commands or even graphical elements
			like specialized toolbars or windows.
			The distribution and user installation of such addons
			is non-trivial ad requires the user to extract archives
			to special paths, move files "by hand" and possibly edit
			configuration files with an editor.
			The goal of this task is to create a builtin addon packaging
			and installation system similar to the one that has
			been created for theme distribution.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Details</strong></p>
		<div class="taskdetails">
			The kvirc svn tree contains the KVS sources for
			<a href="https://svn.kvirc.de/kvirc/browser/trunk/scripts" target="_blank">several addons</a>.
			Some of these addons contain a non standardized "self-installation" procedure
			and other (in fact most of them) must be installed totally by hand.
			We already have <a href="https://svn.kvirc.de/kvirc/browser/trunk/kvirc/src/kvilib/file/kvi_packagefile.cpp" target="_blank">the code for packing and unpacking generic kvirc data</a>
			inside standard distributable binary packages. This packaging stystem has already been used
			to implement the <a href="https://svn.kvirc.de/kvirc/browser/trunk/kvirc/src/modules/theme" target="_blank">distribution of kvirc themes</a>.
			The themes can be both packaged for distribution and installed by using an
			user-friendly wizard-based graphical interface.
			We ask the student to implement a similar approach for the scripting addon subsystem by:
			<ul>
				<li>writing a graphical UI module that allows both packaging (export) and installation (import) of addons
				<li>defining a scripting standard that must be followed by the scripters in order
				to fully take advantage of the new packaging method.
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p><strong>Required additional skills</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Good knowledge of C++
			<li>Knowledge of the KVIrc scripting subsystem.
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Difficulty</strong></p>
		<p>Might be challenging</p>

	<h2><a name="qt4port">Native Qt4 port</a></h2>
	<div class="taskbody">
		<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p>
			The current kvirc source code is strongly based on the Qt3 library
			from <a href="http://www.trolltech.com" target="_blank">TrollTech</a>.
			The <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/index.html" target="_blank">newest Qt4 releases</a>
			are incompatible with Qt3 and existing applications require a huge porting work.
			There is a very fragile and preliminary Qt4 support in kvirc that relies on the
			Qt3Support library provided by TrollTech. The Qt3Support library is meant
			as a temporary fix and will be dropped by TrollTech some time in the future.
			The goal of this task is to remove the dependency on Qt3Support and
			make kvirc a pure Qt4 application.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Details</strong></p>
		<div class="taskdetails">
			We already brought the source tree to a point where it compiles with Qt4 and Qt3Support enabled.
			We also have an <a href="https://svn.kvirc.de/kvirc/browser/branches/kvirc/qmake" target="_blank">experimental branch</a>
			in which we have attempted a native Qt4 port. The branch has important working changes
			but unfortunately has also non-working ones.
			We ask the student to:
			<ul>
				<li>Provide a native Qt4 implementation for the classes in the
					<a href="https://svn.kvirc.de/kvirc/browser/trunk/kvirc/src/kvilib/tal" target="_blank">toolkit abstraction layer</a>,
					eventually by backporting them from the <a href="https://svn.kvirc.de/kvirc/browser/branches/kvirc/qmake" target="_blank">experimental qmake branch</a> to 
					<a href="https://svn.kvirc.de/kvirc/browser/trunk" target="_blank">trunk</a>.
				<li>Substitute the usage of all the Qt3Support classes with Qt4 native ones, eventually providing
					a wrapper implementation in the toolkit abstraction layer.
				<li>Fix the run-time issues caused by the Qt4 internal incompatbilities. This is meant
					particularly for the painting code that shows defects in font metric management
					and slowdowns due to multiple buffering layers.
				<li>Get kvirc to compile without using the Qt3Support library on all the supported platforms
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p><strong>Required additional skills</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Strong knowledge of C++
			<li>Strong knowledge of Qt4 class hierarchy
			<li>Experience in porting applications from Qt3 to Qt4
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Difficulty</strong></p>
		<p>Hard</p>
