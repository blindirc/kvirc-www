Ahinu sent word of a newly opened channel for French speaking KVIrc users.
The channel is located on the Wanadoo/Voila network, one of the largest networks dedicated for french speaking users.
<p>
You can find the channel on irc.voila.fr, its name is #kvirc of course. So if you speak french and need support,
it is definitely worth having a look.
