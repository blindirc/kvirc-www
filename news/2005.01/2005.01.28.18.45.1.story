<p>
KVIrc will support blowfish encryption in future releases. Thus KVIrc should now be compatible with
<a href="http://mircryption.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Mircryption</a> for mIRC or XChat.
There is support for both, CBC and ECB. If you do not want to wait for the next source package, you
might want to try out the CVS version.
