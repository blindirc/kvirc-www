To translate the site just follows these rules:

1) get the last SVN version of the site. To do that simply run
   svn co https://svn.kvirc.de/svn/trunk/www

2) if your language file does not exists, create it using English one
   cp locale_en.php locale_XX.php
   where XX is your language code
   
3) edit your file. To do that simply remove English strings and
   replace them with string in your language. Pay attention to special
   characters as \" or \$ or the translation won't work as expected.
   You MUST USE UTF-8 as coding standard, so make sure your editor will
   use it when saving the translation file
   
4) when you're satisfied about your translation file, upload it to the
   SVN server. If you have not a writeable SVN account, send it to
   hellvis69 [at] gmail [dot] com
   
5) have fun!
